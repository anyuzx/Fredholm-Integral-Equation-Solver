Python code for solving [Fredholm integral equation of the first kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_integral_equation) when the solution should be a probability distribution.

I call this algorithm non-negative Tikhonov regularization with equality constraint (NNETR). For mathematics of this algorithm, please read my blog article [here](https://biophyenvpol.wordpress.com/2019/04/22/use-tikhonov-regularization-to-solve-fredholm-integral-equation/)
