Python code for solving [Fredholm integral equation of the first kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_integral_equation) when the solution should be a probability distribution.

I call this algorithm non-negative Tikhonov regularization with equality constraint (NNETR). For details of this algorithm, please read my [blog article](https://www.guangshi.io/posts/fredholm-equation/)
